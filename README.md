# WCIII-Rot13

Implements a Rot13 cipher that both encodes the plaintext and decodes the encoded text using the same function. It is written in plain JASS.

See the map for details on how the various components are set up.

Load the map, and type in `-rot13 <text>` as an example to convert the text to its Rot13-encoded equivalent.
